## About this project

In this project, I practice using React Router to add client-side routing to a React Application. 
I building a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the animals of a particular species and view the profiles of specific animals.

- Currently, the app renders a `HomePage`component that fetches and displays all adoptable pets.
    - **src/pages/home/index.js**
- We have also built a `PetDetailsPage` to display the details for a particular pet.
    - **src/pages/detail/index.js**

## Objective

The objective is to **add client-side routing to the application** using React Router so that:

- The `HomePage`component responds to the browser’s current URL by displaying only pets of the species the user wishes to view.
- The `PetDetailsPage`page displays when the browser’s current URL includes a specific pet’s `id`
    - It displays data for the correct pet based on the `id`in the URL parameters’ values.
- When the user searches for a pet in the search bar, they are redirected to the `SearchPage`, which uses the query parameter called `name`to filter pets by name.
- When a user clicks a pet whose details are not available, they are redirected to a `PetNotFoundPage`
- From the `PetNotFound`page, users can click “**Go Home**” button that will take them to the root path page.


## Technologies
- React 18
- React Router 6
- uses Mock Service Worker (MSW) to replicate the functionality of an external API.
